# ðŸš€ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Since GitHub CLI had authentication issues, follow these manual steps to create the repository and push your code.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (Manual)

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account (`prajvalrasik`)

2. **Create New Repository:**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right â†’ "New repository"
   - Repository name: `healthos-web`
   - Description: `HealthOS Web MVP - Comprehensive health data management platform with Google Fit integration, AI-powered lab report processing, and intelligent health assistant`
   - Set to **Public** âœ…
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Choose a license" (we'll add one later)
   - Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Verify remote is set (should show the GitHub URL)
git remote -v

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, you may need to:

### Option A: Use Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Use token as password when prompted

### Option B: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Clone the repository after creating it
3. Copy your files to the cloned folder
4. Commit and push through GitHub Desktop

## Step 3: Verify Repository

After pushing, verify:
- [ ] Repository shows all files
- [ ] README.md displays properly
- [ ] All commits are visible
- [ ] Repository is public

## Step 4: Repository Settings

Once repository is created:

1. **Add Topics/Tags:**
   - Go to repository â†’ Settings â†’ General
   - Add topics: `nextjs`, `typescript`, `supabase`, `health-tech`, `ai`, `google-fit`, `mvp`

2. **Set Repository Description:**
   - Should already be set from creation

3. **Enable Issues and Discussions:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ General â†’ Features
   - Enable Issues âœ…
   - Enable Discussions âœ… (optional)

## Step 5: Add License (Optional)

1. In your repository, click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file"
2. Name it `LICENSE`
3. Choose MIT License template
4. Commit the file

## Current Repository Status

âœ… **Ready for GitHub:**
- Git repository initialized
- All code committed
- Remote origin configured
- Documentation complete
- Security measures in place

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (Step 8.2)
2. **Configure environment variables**
3. **Test production deployment**
4. **Invite pilot users** (Step 8.3)
